# TODO

* Build in pallet swapping instead of separate image source for each color difference: https://github.com/Colbydude/phaser-3-palette-swapping-example
* Change hull name to cargo bay and allow for different "hull" upgrades that increase health
* allow discarding material to lighten load
* add refurbished teleporters that sometimes don't work and sometimes aren't very accurate
* add engine upgrade to increase base speed
* initial fuel tank and cargo bay need to be MUCH less capacity
